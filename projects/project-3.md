What am I actually making? is an android application written in Java using native android develpment tools. The purpose of the application is to assist those among us who do not make a consistent wage better understand how much they are earning.  

Some feature include: dark and light mode, custom pickers and nice statistics.  

This was one of the first (larger scale) applications I wrote and despite the crude interface I am quite proud of my achievement.
