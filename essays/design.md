# Structured Design

There are many ways to go about writing code. The best way is to just start writing. Of course, after reading this you might think "well why didn't I try that!?" The answer to that question being, "just start writing" is a pattern that only exists for those who are quite enthuiastic about their work. For the rest of us, certain design patterns exist to keep us on track.  

## Test Driven Development  

This pattern is probably the QA's dream. The developer is given requirements, which are then converted to tests, which the developer needs to write code that passes. This type of development lends itself towards leaner code that is more obvious to write. Meaning, because work can be checked instantaneously, developers can work in peace.  

## Issue Driven Development  

For my latest project, we used this type of design pattern to accomplish our work. Similarly to test driven development, it's easy to know when you're done. Also existing technology (git) helps provide the framework to make this pattern more feasible. Github allows users to create a Kanban board where users can write problems and fulfil them. This board is quite simple and very easy to manage. These aspects really make test-driven development much easier than other types.  

## Issue Driven Development in Action  

My latest project [opportunity searcher](https://github.com/opportunity-searcher/opportunity-searcher) uses issue driven development. From our professor, we were given a set of requirements. Those were then converted into issues and put on our kanban board. The nice thing about this process is that we knew we were done when we cleared all the issues. While we had more thoughts in our head about how we could improve the codebase, the requirements were already met and anything else was just desserts.
